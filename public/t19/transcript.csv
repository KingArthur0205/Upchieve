73,00:03:41:10,00:03:43:01,00:00:01:21,Teacher E,English,It could also be divide by 3.,,,b,

97,00:04:54:14,00:04:55:10,00:00:00:26,Teacher E,English,It would have said 10.,,,b,
98,00:04:55:17,00:05:00:28,00:00:05:09,Teacher E,English,"And it can be to take the ones digit, because if they were doing that, what would it say on the output?",,,b,

104,00:05:11:27,00:05:15:20,00:00:03:23,Teacher E,English,"So, I'm gonna open up the next screen, I just wanna go over something with you before you start.",,,b,
