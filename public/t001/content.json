    "gradeLevel": "Grade: 7, Unit 3: Measuring Circles, Lesson 6: Exploring Circle Area",
    "lessonGoal": "In this lesson, students estimate and use repeated reasoning (MP8) to make sense of the relationship between the radius of a circle, the square of the radius, and the area of the circle. This lesson uses radius squares (a square whose side length is the radius of a circle) to help students visualize these relationships. At the end of the lesson, students should know a formula for the relationship between the radius of a circle and its area.",
