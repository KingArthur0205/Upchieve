Initial Strategies,Strategy: Underestimating by counting full squares only,1,1,relationship between pi and measure of circle,1,34 (counting inner shape of full squares),1,1,1,Full Squares
Radius Squares * Pi,Strategy 2: Overestimating using the area of a square circumscribing the circle,2,2,3 radius squares = area of circle,2,24 (diameter times 3),2,2,2,Length X Width
Cutting Radius Squares,Strategy 3: Using the circumference formula,3,3,,3,64 (8x8),,3,3,Pi x diameter
,Deciding between 3 and 4 radius squares to cover the circle,4,4,,4,Under and overestimation,,4,4,4 radius squares
