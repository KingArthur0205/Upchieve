# Learning Goals for Transcript 001

## Unit Purpose
Describe the relationship between the radius of any circle and its area as the square of the radius times Ï€.
Estimate and calculate the area of a circle.

## Lesson Purpose  
In this lesson, students estimate and use repeated reasoning (MP8) to make sense of the relationship between the radius of a circle, the square of the radius, and the area of the circle.

This lesson uses radius squares (a square whose side length is the radius of a circle) to help students visualize these relationships.

At the end of the lesson, students should know a formula for the relationship between the radius of a circle and its area.
